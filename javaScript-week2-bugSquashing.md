Bug squashing lecture:
- good naming conventions for variables and functions
- test early and often
- develop your debugging process
- replicate the error, isolate the error
- investigate your variables





After lecture:
- build remove task functionality
- figure out how to clear task form after task added to list
  - does it clear with solution code? if so, use debugger to go line by line
- next lab!
